How could you design your system so that each character race could be easily generated? Additionally, how difficult does such a solution make adding additional classes?

How does your system handle generating different enemies? Is it different from how you generate the player character? Why or why not?

How could you implement the various abilities for the enemy characters? Do you use the same techniques as for the player character races? Explain.

What design pattern could you use to model the effects of temporary potions so that you do not need to explicitly track which potions the player character has consumed on any particular floor?

How could you generate items so that the generation of treasure and potions reuses as much code as possible? That is, how would you structure your system so that the generation of a potion and generation of treasure does not duplicate code?
